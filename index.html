Rent prices in New York City boroughs reached an all time high this year. As landlords attempt to compensate for significant discounts given to renters during the pandemic, dramatic surges in rent prices have established New York City as the most expensive city in the U.S.

High rent costs have financially disadvantaged some New York renters, who are generally expected to make an annual salary that equals 40 times their monthly rent. Households that do not meet these standards are considered to be rent burdened if 30% or more of their income is spent on housing.</p> </div>

<p> A correlation between socio-economic status and rent burden can be seen when observing the percentage of rent burdened households in each community district. At 58%, the highest population of rent burdened households is in Bronx Community District 5, where 37% of residents live below the poverty line and 42% of residents are described as “foreign-born.” In Bronx Community District 5, the average monthly rent cost is over $1,900. In stark contrast, Manhattan Community District 1 has a very small immigrant population, a low percentage of residents living below the poverty line (8%), and the least amount of rent burdened residents in Manhattan where the average rent cost is over $4,000 a month as of August 2022.
